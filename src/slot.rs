/// Reserves local memory/storage/a _slot_ which shall be capable of
/// [`.holding()`][`Slot::holding()`] an owned value of type `T` in order to
/// expose an [`OwnRef<'slot, T>`] without the need for macros nor callbacks.
///
///   - The very design and point of [`OwnRef`] is to split the _conceptual
///     ownership_ (_i.e._, `drop` ability and responsibility) of some `value: T`
///     from the memory management of the _backing storage_
///     [holding][`Slot::holding()`] the bytes that constitute this value.
///     Mainly, it is perfectly fine to _consume_, in an owning fashion (_e.g._,
///     by `drop`ping it), the `T` itself, whilst this backing memory outlives it /
///     with the backing memory oblivious to this fact / none the wiser.
///
/// And yet, the <code>let r = [own_ref!]\(value\);</code> expression only yields
/// the "handle" owning the `value`, with no such backing storage in sight.
///
/// This is achieved thanks to the expression _temporaries_, and very convoluted
/// hoops to get Rust to lengthen the lifetime of these as much as possible.
///
/// But there are limits to what these hoops can do. The following, for
/// instance, fails to compile:
///
/// ```rust ,compile_fail
/// use ::own_ref::prelude::*;
///
/// let some_option: Option<String> = // ...
/// # None;
///
/// let some_ownref: Option<OwnRef<'_, String>> =
///     some_option.map(|s| own_ref!(s))
/// ;
/// dbg!(&some_ownref);
/// ```

/// This is when [`slot()`] shines: by explicitly and directly managing the

/// lifetime of our [`OwnRef<'slot, T>`], resulting in an [`OwnRef`]
/// which can be used for longer.
///
/// ```rust
/// use ::own_ref::prelude::*;
///
/// let some_option: Option<String> = // ...
/// # None;
///
/// // 1. Declare a `let storage = &mut slot();` sufficiently early/high in the
/// // `fn` body:
/// let storage = &mut slot(); // üëà
///
/// // 2. Use `storage.holding(value)` instead of `own_ref!(value)`.
/// let some_ownref: Option<OwnRef<'_, String>> =
///  // some_option.map(|s| own_ref!(s))        // ‚ùå
///     some_option.map(|s| storage.holding(s)) // ‚úÖ
/// ;
/// // 3. Profit‚Ñ¢
/// dbg!(&some_ownref);
/// ```
///
/// [`OwnRef<'slot, T>`]: OwnRef
///
/// The too-astute-for-their-own-good/awarerer reader may suggest that lifetime
/// extension shenanigans could still be applied here:
///
/// ```rust
/// use ::own_ref::prelude::*;
///
/// let some_option: Option<String> = // ...
/// # None;
///
/// let some_ownref: Option<OwnRef<'_, String>> =
///     if let Some(s) = some_option {
///         Some {
///             0: own_ref!(s), // ü§°
///         }
///     } else {
///         None
///     }
